# Snake4k

Good old snake game wrapped in a Java desktop application.

# Ideas

* Config could be configured in view via some start-game-dialog; via some defined presets:
    * Fruit: Nut - Apple - Steak (changing the fruit growth)
    * Map size
    * Option: Can go through walls
    * !!! Option: Small delay when hit something
* Even more sophisticated keyboard watcher
    * Check only for most recent 2 key strokes, remove all others and put those in queue
* High score at the end (store in preferences; along with settings)
* Sounds (can be disabled), visual flashes
    * When fruit eaten, when game over
* Change color theme
* When display is completely full with snake => kabaaam happens! :)
