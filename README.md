# Snake4k

Good old snake game wrapped in a Java desktop application.

# Ideas

* Config could be configured in view via some start-game-dialog; via some defined presets:
    * Fruit: Nut - Apple - Steak (changing the fruit growth)
    * Map size
    * Option: Can go through walls
    * !!! Option: Small delay when hit something
* Sounds (can be disabled), visual flashes
    * When fruit eaten, when game over
